## Bugs Found and Fixed

### üêõ Bug #1: Archive Functionality Failed

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** FIXED

**Description:**  
When attempting to archive an order, the system returned error:
```
Error: Failed to archive order
PGRST116: The result contains 0 rows
Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `updateOrderSchema` validation schema in `lib/spare-parts/validation.ts` did not include the `archived` field, causing the API to reject the request.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// lib/spare-parts/validation.ts
export const updateOrderSchema = z.object({
  status: orderStatusSchema.optional(),
  admin_notes: z.string().optional(),
  whatsapp_conversation_started: z.boolean().optional(),
  archived: z.boolean().optional(), // ‚Üê Added this line
});
```

**Additional Fix:**  
Updated the orders API route to filter out archived orders:
```typescript
// app/api/spare-parts/orders/route.ts
let query = supabase
  .from('spare_parts_orders')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact' })
  .eq('archived', false); // ‚Üê Added this filter
```

**Verification:**  
- Order successfully archived
- Database confirmed `archived = true`
- Order hidden from orders list
- Stats updated correctly

---

## Database Verification

### Order State After Testing

```sql
SELECT 
  order_number, 
  status, 
  archived, 
  admin_notes 
FROM spare_parts_orders 
WHERE order_number = 'CW-20251016-806';
```

**Result:**
- order_number: CW-20251016-806
- status: cancelled
- archived: false (unarchived for continued testing)
- admin_notes: "Customer requested cancellation - changed mind about the order"

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Add `archived` field to validation schema
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Filter archived orders from main list
3. üîÑ **TODO:** Complete delete functionality testing
4. üîÑ **TODO:** Verify email notifications are sent on status changes

### Medium Priority
1. Add ESC key handler to close modals
2. Add click-outside handler to close modals
3. Test responsive design on mobile viewports
4. Add loading states during API calls
5. Add success toast notifications instead of just updating silently

### Low Priority
1. Add keyboard navigation for modal buttons
2. Add animation transitions for modal open/close
3. Consider adding undo functionality for accidental actions
