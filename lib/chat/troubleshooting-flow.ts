        "Make sure all vents in the room are open and not blocked by furniture or curtains.",

        "A **grinding** or **squealing** noise often indicates a serious motor or belt issue. If you hear this, please turn off the AC immediately to prevent further damage.",
        "A **clicking** sound is often normal during startup and shutdown. However, if it's continuous, it could be a relay problem.",
        "A **buzzing** sound can indicate an electrical issue. If it's loud or persistent, turn off the unit.",
