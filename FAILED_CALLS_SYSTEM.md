### Password Configuration

## üìã Kanban Board Structure

The system uses 5 columns to track failed call resolution:

### 1. New Failed Calls
- Fresh customer reports
- Unassigned tasks requiring attention
- Auto-created from chat agent

### 2. Customer Unavailable  
- Customer can't take calls at the moment

## üì± Task Card Features

Each task card displays:
- **Customer name** (prominent header)

- **Problem description** (from conversation)
- **Timestamp** when reported
- **Priority indicator** (red=urgent, yellow=medium, green=low)

2. System automatically opens phone dialer
3. Phone numbers are cleaned and formatted
4. Attempt counter increments automatically
5. Works on desktop and mobile browsers

### Phone Number Support
- Formats: (555) 123-4567, 555-123-4567, 5551234567
- International numbers with country codes
- Automatic cleaning removes formatting for dialing

## üéØ Drag & Drop Interface

### Usage
1. **Drag** any task card to move between columns
2. **Drop** in target column to update status
3. **Visual feedback** during drag operations
4. **Auto-save** - changes persist immediately
5. **Mobile support** - touch-friendly interactions

### Status Changes
- Dragging automatically updates task status
- Changes are saved to database immediately
- No confirmation required for status updates

## ü§ñ Chat Agent Integration with AI Priority Analysis

### Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects failed call mentions in chat:

**Trigger phrases:**
- "I tried calling but no answer"
- "Couldn't reach you"
- "Phone went to voicemail" 
- "No one picked up"
- "Called but didn't get through"

### üß† AI-Powered Priority Analysis
The system uses Google's Gemini AI to intelligently analyze customer problems:

**Priority Grading (1-3 Scale):**
- **Priority 1 (HIGH)**: Emergency situations requiring immediate response (2-4 hours)
  - Complete appliance breakdown in extreme conditions
  - Safety hazards (electrical issues, gas leaks, overheating)
  - Health-related concerns (medicines, elderly/children affected)
  - Business operations affected (commercial customers)

- **Priority 2 (MEDIUM)**: Important issues requiring same-day response (24 hours)
  - Partial functionality loss but appliance still working
  - Intermittent problems affecting daily routine
  - Service appointments and maintenance needs

- **Priority 3 (LOW)**: Routine issues that can wait (2-3 business days)
  - Routine maintenance requests
  - Cosmetic issues or minor repairs
  - Information inquiries and general questions

### Auto-Response Templates
Based on AI priority analysis, the agent responds:

**AI Priority 1 (High):**
> "Thanks for letting me know, [Name]. I've logged this as urgent and you'll receive a callback within the next few hours about your [issue]."

**AI Priority 2 (Medium):**
> "Noted! I've logged your request and someone will reach out to you within 24 hours to help with your [issue]."

**AI Priority 3 (Low):**
> "I've recorded your request, [Name]. You'll receive a callback within 2-3 business days to help with your [issue]."

### Silent AI Operation
- **Customer Unaware**: All AI analysis happens in the background
- **No Interaction**: Customers don't know their problems are being analyzed
- **Automatic Processing**: Priority assignment happens instantly
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing chat flows

### Integration Example
```typescript
import { processMessageForFailedCall } from '../lib/chat-agent-integration';

// In your chat handler
const result = await processMessageForFailedCall(userMessage, chatSession);
if (result.shouldCreateTask) {
  return result.suggestedResponse;
}
```
