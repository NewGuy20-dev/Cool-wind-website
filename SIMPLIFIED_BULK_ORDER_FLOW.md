## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. **Smart Extraction** (`lib/chat/bulk-order-handler.ts`)
- `extractQuantity()` - Finds numbers in message (10, 5, 20, etc.)
- `extractPartName()` - Identifies part keywords (remote control, compressor, etc.)
- Works from the FIRST message - no multi-step collection needed

### 2. **Immediate Calculation**
- When quantity + part name detected → Calculate price immediately
- Show bulk discount if applicable (5+ units)
- Ask for contact info right away

### 3. **One-Shot Contact Collection**
- User can provide "Name, Phone, Email" in one message
- `extractContactInfo()` parses all three at once
- No back-and-forth asking for each field separately

### 4. **Instant Confirmation**
- Shows pickup location immediately after contact info
- Clear "Yes/No" buttons for confirmation
- No extra steps

## 📊 Comparison

User: "Gautham"
AI: "Phone?"
User: "9876543210"
AI: "Email?"

```

### New Flow (2-3 messages):
```
User: "I want to order 10 remote controls"
AI: "Great! 10 × ₹350 = ₹3,500. Provide name, phone, email"
User: "Gautham, 9876543210, test@gmail.com"
AI: "Perfect! Pickup at [address]. Confirm?"
