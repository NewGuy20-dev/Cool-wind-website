✅ Task creation logic: Ready for integration

🔧 SYSTEM STATUS: Ready for production deployment!

📋 ADMIN CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Set ADMIN_API_KEY environment variable
- [ ] Test task creation API endpoint
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard access
- [ ] Test all trigger phrases in live chat
- [ ] Monitor console logs for detection events
- [ ] Check task creation in admin panel

🚀 The failed call detection system is fully implemented and ready!
