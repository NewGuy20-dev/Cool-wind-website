# Spare Parts Catalog Feature - Proposal

**Subject:** New Feature to Grow Your Spare Parts Business Online

---

Hi

I tried to search for places for adding spare parts photo to the website as you suggested but it wasnt available so iam suggesting a new feature which allows us to do that and also allow customers to see what parts is in stock and which is not!


## What We'll Add to Your Website

A complete **Spare Parts Catalog** where customers can:
- 📱 Browse all your AC and refrigerator parts with clear photos and prices
- 🔍 Search for the exact part they need (by name, brand, or model)
- 💰 See bulk pricing discounts automatically (perfect for attracting technicians and dealers)
- 💬 Place orders directly through your existing chat system - no phone calls needed
- 📧 Get instant email confirmation of their order

## What You'll Get

A simple **Admin Panel** (added to your existing dashboard) where you can:
- ➕ Add new parts with photos in minutes (as easy as posting on social media)
- 📊 Update stock levels and prices anytime
- ✅ Mark all bulk order requests in one organized place
- 🔔 Get automatic email notifications when someone places an order
- 📈 Track which parts are most popular

## Real Benefits for Your Business

✅ **Sell 24/7** - Customers can browse and order even when you're busy with repairs  
✅ **Attract Bulk Buyers** - Technicians and dealers can see pricing upfront and place large orders  
✅ **Reduce Phone Calls** - Customers find parts themselves instead of calling  
✅ **Professional Image** - Stand out from competitors with a modern online catalog  
✅ **More Revenue** - Capture online sales you're currently missing  

## How It Works for Customers

1. Customer visits your website and goes to "Spare Parts"
2. They search or browse for the part they need
3. They see the price, stock availability, and photos
4. They place an order through the chat (AI collects all details)
5. You get an email with their order and contact info
6. You follow up via phone or WhatsApp to confirm

## Email Setup (Professional Touch)

We'll set up professional email addresses for your business:
- **info@coolwind.co.in** - For customer inquiries and order confirmations
- **orders@coolwind.co.in** - For bulk order notifications

This looks much more professional than Gmail and builds customer trust. All emails will automatically forward to my email first (for development and testing), and I can forward important ones to you, or we can set it up to forward directly to your Gmail or a custom mail if you want  once everything is live.

**Note:** I've already completed the forwarding email setup - it's active and ready to use! When customers receive order confirmations, they'll see "Cool Wind Services <info@coolwind.co.in>" which looks very professional.It also makes sure your personal email stays private.

## Investment

**Monthly Cost:** ₹0 (uses your existing website hosting and free email forwarding)  
**Timeline:** Ready in 1 week

## Expected Results

Based on similar businesses:
- 20-30% increase in spare parts sales
- 5-10 hours saved per week (fewer phone inquiries)
- 3-5x more customer reach (people searching online)
- Professional image that builds trust

## Next Steps

If you'd like to move forward:
1. Reply "Yes, let's do it"
2. I'll need about 30 minutes of your time to:
   - Get a list of your most popular parts
   - Collect some part photos (or I can help take them)
3. I'll build everything and show you a demo
4. You review and we launch!

Let me know what you think. Happy to answer any questions!

Best regards,  
Gautham

**P.S.** - This will also help with Google search rankings. When people search for "AC compressor Thiruvalla" or "refrigerator parts Kerala", your website will show up with actual products, not just services.
