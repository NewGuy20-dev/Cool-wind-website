# Bulk Order Chat Flow - Fix Applied

## üêõ Issue Found
The AI was correctly starting the bulk order flow but then "forgetting" the context and asking generic questions instead of completing the order collection.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Smart Information Extraction**
- Added `extractContactInfo()` function that parses natural language
- Extracts name, phone, email from a single message
- Example: "my name is Gautham and phone is 9876543210 and email is test@gmail.com"
  - Extracts all three pieces of information at once

### 2. **State Persistence**
- Bulk order state now persists across messages
- System checks for existing bulk order state before starting new flow
- Continues from where it left off

### 3. **AI Mode Awareness**
- Added `inBulkOrderMode` flag to Gemini client
- When in bulk order mode, AI receives special instructions:
  - Don't ask generic questions
  - Don't change topics
  - Let the bulk order handler manage the flow

### 4. **Smarter Missing Info Detection**
- System tracks what info has been collected
- Only asks for what's still missing
- If only delivery location is missing, asks specifically for that

## üéØ Expected Flow Now

**User:** "I want to order 10 remote controls"

**AI:** "Great! I can help you with that. You're looking for 10 AC Remote Controls Universal, correct? These are ‚Çπ350 each (bulk price). That's 10 √ó ‚Çπ350 = ‚Çπ3,500.

To proceed, I need:
1. Your Name
2. Phone Number
3. Email Address
4. Delivery Location"

**User:** "my name is Gautham and phone number is 9876543210 and email address is techuse730@gmail.com"

**System:** *Extracts: name=Gautham, phone=9876543210, email=techuse730@gmail.com*

**AI:** "Perfect! Last thing - where should we prepare the order for pickup?

üìç Our shop is at: Pushpagiri Hospitals Rd, Thiruvalla, Kerala 689101"

**User:** "Thiruvalla"

**AI:** "üìã Order Summary

Items: AC Remote Control Universal x 10
Total: ‚Çπ3,500

Customer: Gautham
Phone: 9876543210
Email: techuse730@gmail.com
Pickup: Thiruvalla

‚úÖ Confirm this order?"

**User:** "Yes"

**System:** *Creates order, sends emails*

**AI:** "‚úÖ Order placed successfully! You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with pickup instructions.

üìç Pickup Location:
Cool Wind Services
Pushpagiri Hospitals Rd
Thiruvalla, Kerala 689101

Ready in 2-4 hours!"

## üß™ Test Again

Try this conversation in the chat widget:

```
You: I want to order 10 remote controls
AI: [Confirms parts and pricing, asks for info]
You: my name is Gautham and phone is 9876543210 and email is test@gmail.com
AI: [Should ask ONLY for delivery location]
You: Thiruvalla
AI: [Shows order summary]
You: Yes, place order
AI: [Confirms order placed]
```

## üìù Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **lib/chat/bulk-order-handler.ts**
   - Added `extractContactInfo()` function
   - Enhanced `collecting_contact` step to extract all info at once
   - Smarter missing info detection

2. **lib/gemini/client.ts**
   - Added `inBulkOrderMode` parameter
   - Special instructions when in bulk order mode
   - Prevents AI from interfering with order flow

3. **app/api/chat/route.ts**
   - Checks for existing bulk order state
   - Passes bulk order mode flag to AI
   - Better state management

## ‚ú® Result

The chat now maintains context throughout the bulk order process and doesn't "forget" what it's doing. The AI works cooperatively with the bulk order handler instead of competing with it.
