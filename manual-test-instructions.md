# Manual Carousel Test Instructions

## Step 1: Open the Browser
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` 
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab

## Step 2: Look for Debug Elements
You should see:
- **Red debug counter** in top-left corner showing "TESTIMONIAL X of Y"
- **Large red "Previous" button** on the left
- **Large green "Next" button** on the right
- **Numbered dot indicators** below the testimonial

## Step 3: Check Console Logs
In the console, you should see logs like:
```
üé† Carousel rendered: { totalTestimonials: 6, currentIndex: 0, currentTestimonial: 'Priya M.' }
üîÑ currentIndex CHANGED to: 0
‚è∞ Setting up auto-scroll interval for 6 testimonials
```

## Step 4: Test Manual Navigation
1. **Click the GREEN "Next" button** (right side)
2. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   üî¥ NEXT BUTTON FUNCTION CALLED!
   üî¥ CHANGING INDEX FROM 0 TO 1
   üî¥ setCurrentIndex called with: 1
   üîÑ currentIndex CHANGED to: 1
   ```
3. **Watch the red debug counter** - it should change from "TESTIMONIAL 1 of 6" to "TESTIMONIAL 2 of 6"
4. **Watch the testimonial text** - it should change from "TESTIMONIAL #1: ..." to "TESTIMONIAL #2: ..."

## Step 5: Test Dot Indicators
1. **Click on the numbered dots** below the carousel
2. **Watch console** for:
   ```
   üî¥ DOT INDICATOR FUNCTION CALLED for slide X!
   üî¥ setCurrentIndex called with: X
   ```

## Step 6: Test Auto-scroll
1. **Wait 8-10 seconds** without interacting
2. **Watch console** for:
   ```
   ‚è∞ Auto-scroll triggered - moving from index 0
   ‚è∞ Moving to index 1
   ```
3. **Hover over the carousel** - auto-scroll should pause
4. **Move mouse away** - auto-scroll should resume

## Expected Results vs Issues

### ‚úÖ If Working:
- Debug counter changes numbers
- Testimonial text changes content
- Console shows all the debug messages
- Visual changes are obvious

### ‚ùå If Broken:
- Debug counter stays at "TESTIMONIAL 1 of 6"
- No console logs when clicking buttons
- Testimonial content doesn't change
- Buttons might not be clickable

## Troubleshooting

### If buttons aren't clickable:
- Check if they have red/green colors and are visible
- Try right-clicking and "Inspect Element" to verify they're actual buttons
- Check if there are any JavaScript errors in console

### If functions are called but state doesn't change:
- Look for React errors in console
- Check if `üîÑ currentIndex CHANGED` logs appear
- Verify testimonials array has multiple items

### If nothing happens at all:
- Check if carousel component is actually rendered
- Look for any JavaScript errors
- Verify testimonials data is being passed correctly

## What to Report Back
Please share:
1. **What you see visually** (debug counter, button colors, etc.)
2. **Console log output** when clicking buttons
3. **Whether the testimonial content changes**
4. **Any error messages** in the console
5. **Screenshots** if possible

This will help pinpoint exactly where the issue is occurring!
