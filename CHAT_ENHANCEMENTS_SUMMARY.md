## 🎯 How It Works

### Example Conversation Flow:

**Customer:** "Hi, I need some AC parts"

**AI:** "Hello! 👋 I can help you with AC spare parts. We have compressors, filters, thermostats, remote controls, and more in stock. What specific part are you looking for, or would you like me to show you our AC parts catalog?"

**Customer:** "Show me compressors"

**AI:** "Here are our available AC compressors:

**AC Compressors:**
- LG 1.5 Ton Compressor (CMP-LG-1.5T)
  Price: ₹7,500 | Bulk (5+): ₹7,000
  ✓ Genuine | 12 months warranty
  Stock: Available

- Samsung 1 Ton Compressor (CMP-SAM-1T)
  Price: ₹6,500 | Bulk (5+): ₹6,000
  ✓ Genuine | 12 months warranty
  Stock: Available

Would you like to order any of these? I can help you place a bulk order with special pricing!"

**Customer:** "I need 5 LG compressors"

**AI:** "Great choice! 5 LG 1.5 Ton Compressors at bulk price:
5 × ₹7,000 = ₹35,000 (You save ₹2,500!)

To complete your order, I'll need:
1. Your name
2. Phone number
3. Email address
4. Delivery location

Let's start - what's your name?"
