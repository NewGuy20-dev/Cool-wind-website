# Session Persistence Fix - Bulk Order Continuation Issue

## Problem Identified

### Issue 1: Session Not Persisting Between Requests
**Symptom**: 
- First message creates session `b840918e-9665-48be-9533-a000bfceb596`
- Second message creates NEW session `50be7ff3-88f2-4d52-890c-9e95a3716f7b`
- Bulk order context is lost

**Root Cause**:
The server was only checking the in-memory `sessions` Map for existing sessions. When a request came in with a sessionId that existed in the database but not in memory, it would create a brand new session instead of restoring the existing one.

```typescript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
let sessionData = sessionId ? getSession(sessionId) : null;
if (!sessionData) {
  sessionData = createSession(userId || uuidv4()); // Creates NEW session!
}
```

### Issue 2: Wrong Flow After Session Loss
**Symptom**:
- Second message asks for "delivery location" 
- Should continue bulk order flow (collecting contact info)
- Instead goes to regular Gemini AI

**Root Cause**:
Because the session was lost, the bulk order state was not found. The system then:
1. Checked for failed call triggers (found none)
2. Fell through to regular Gemini AI
3. Gemini AI asked for location (not knowing it's pickup-only)

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Database Session Restoration

Added logic to check the database for existing sessions before creating new ones:

```typescript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
let sessionData = sessionId ? getSession(sessionId) : null;

// If not in memory but we have a sessionId, check if it exists in database
if (!sessionData && sessionId) {
  // Check if session has state in database (means it's valid)
  const hasDbState = await ChatStateManager.getChatState(sessionId, 'bulk_order') || 
                     await ChatStateManager.getCallbackInfoState(sessionId);
  
  if (hasDbState) {
    // Session exists in DB, recreate in memory
    console.log('‚ôªÔ∏è Restoring session from database:', sessionId);
    sessionData = {
      context: new ConversationContext(),
      session: {
        sessionId,
        userId: userId || uuidv4(),
        startTime: new Date(),
        messages: [],
        context: {
          resolved: false,
          escalated: false
        }
      }
    };
    sessions.set(sessionId, sessionData);
  }
}

// If still no session, create new one
if (!sessionData) {
  sessionData = createSession(userId || uuidv4());
  sessionId = sessionData.session.sessionId;
}
```

### Fix 2: Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging to track bulk order state:

```typescript
console.log('üîç Bulk order state check:', {
  sessionId: session.sessionId,
  hasExistingState: !!existingBulkOrderState,
  stateStep: existingBulkOrderState?.step,
  isBulkOrderActive
});
```

## How It Works Now

### Request Flow

1. **Client sends message** with sessionId (from cookie or state)
2. **Server checks in-memory sessions** first (fast path)
3. **If not in memory**, checks database for bulk_order or callback state
4. **If found in database**, recreates session in memory
5. **Continues with existing context** instead of creating new session

### Bulk Order Flow (Fixed)

```
User: "Hi so i need to buy 11 remote controls"
‚îú‚îÄ Session: b840918e-9665-48be-9533-a000bfceb596 (created)
‚îú‚îÄ Bulk order detected
‚îú‚îÄ State saved to DB: { step: 'collecting_contact', parts: [...] }
‚îî‚îÄ Response: "To confirm your order, please provide: Name, Phone, Email"

User: "Name is Hari and phone number is 8848850922 and email is techuse730@gmail.com"
‚îú‚îÄ Session: b840918e-9665-48be-9533-a000bfceb596 (RESTORED from DB)
‚îú‚îÄ Bulk order state found: { step: 'collecting_contact', parts: [...] }
‚îú‚îÄ Contact info extracted: { name: "Hari", phone: "8848850922", email: "..." }
‚îú‚îÄ All info collected ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ State updated: { step: 'confirming', deliveryLocation: 'Thiruvalla, Kerala' }
‚îî‚îÄ Response: "Perfect! Pickup Location: Cool Wind Services... Confirm this order?"
```

## What Changed

### File: `app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Lines 100-130**: Added database session restoration logic

**Before**:
- Only checked in-memory sessions
- Created new session if not found

**After**:
- Checks in-memory sessions first
- If not found, checks database for state
- Restores session from database if state exists
- Only creates new session if truly doesn't exist

---

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Bulk Order Continuation
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open chat widget
# Send: "I need 11 remote controls"
# Expected: Bulk order detected, asks for contact info

# Send: "Name is Hari, phone 8848850922, email test@example.com"
# Expected: ‚úÖ Continues bulk order flow
# Expected: ‚úÖ Shows pickup location
# Expected: ‚úÖ Asks for confirmation
# Expected: ‚ùå Does NOT ask for delivery location
# Expected: ‚ùå Does NOT create new session
```

### Test Scenario 2: Session Persistence
```bash
# Check console logs for:
‚úÖ "‚ôªÔ∏è Restoring session from database: [sessionId]"
‚úÖ "üîç Bulk order state check: { hasExistingState: true, stateStep: 'collecting_contact' }"
‚úÖ "üõí Bulk order flow active or detected!"
‚úÖ "üéØ Using bulk order response, next step: confirming"

# Should NOT see:
‚ùå "‚ö†Ô∏è No state found in database for session [sessionId]"
‚ùå New session ID created for second message
‚ùå "üí¨ Generating normal Gemini response..."
```

## Why This Happened

### Architecture Issue
The system uses a **hybrid storage approach**:
- **In-memory Map**: Fast access for active sessions
- **Supabase Database**: Persistent storage for state

The problem was that the in-memory Map is cleared when:
- Server restarts
- Session timeout (30 minutes)
- Memory pressure

But the database state persists. The code wasn't checking the database before deciding to create a new session.

### Cookie vs Session Mismatch
The client was correctly sending the sessionId in cookies, but the server was ignoring it because it wasn't in the in-memory Map.

---

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Session Continuity**: Sessions survive server restarts
2. **Better UX**: Users don't lose context mid-conversation
3. **Bulk Orders Work**: Multi-step flows complete successfully
4. **Failed Calls Work**: Callback collection continues properly
5. **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent users (sessions can be evicted from memory)

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Session in DB but expired
- Database state exists but is old
- System restores it anyway (user can clear chat if needed)
- Alternative: Add timestamp check and expire old states

### Case 2: Session in memory but not in DB
- Normal case for new conversations
- No database state needed yet
- Works as before

### Case 3: Session in both memory and DB
- Fast path: Uses in-memory version
- Database is source of truth for state
- Works correctly

### Case 4: No session anywhere
- Creates new session
- Works as before

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Session restoration rate (how often we restore from DB)
- Session creation rate (should decrease)
- Bulk order completion rate (should increase)
- Failed call completion rate (should increase)

### Log Messages
```
‚ôªÔ∏è Restoring session from database: [sessionId]  # Good - session restored
üîç Bulk order state check: { hasExistingState: true }  # Good - state found
‚ö†Ô∏è No state found in database for session [sessionId]  # Normal for new sessions
```

---

## Future Improvements

### Short Term
1. Add session expiration check (e.g., 24 hours)
2. Clean up old database states periodically
3. Add metrics for session restoration

### Medium Term
1. Migrate to Redis for session storage (faster than DB)
2. Add session replication for high availability
3. Implement session migration for server updates

### Long Term
1. Distributed session management
2. Session clustering
3. Cross-region session sync

2. **Verify logs**: Check console for session restoration messages
3. **Test edge cases**: Try page refresh, multiple tabs, etc.
4. **Deploy**: Push to production once verified
