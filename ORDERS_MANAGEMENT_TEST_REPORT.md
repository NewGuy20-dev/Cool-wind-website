**Root Cause**:
The PUT endpoint is trying to select and return the updated row, but the query isn't finding it. Possible issues:
1. The `archived` field might not exist in the database

3. RLS policies might be blocking the update

**Recommendation**: Check the API endpoint and database schema

## Browser Console Errors

### Archive Error
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error archiving order: Error: Failed to archive order
Error performing action: Error: Failed to archive order
```

**Error Details**:
- HTTP Status: 500
- Endpoint: PUT /api/spare-parts/orders/[id]
- Body: { archived: true }
- Response: PGRST116 - Cannot coerce result to single JSON object

## Database Verification Needed

### Check These:
1. Does `spare_parts_orders` table have `archived` column?
2. Is the column type BOOLEAN?
3. Are there any RLS policies blocking updates?
4. Is the query using `.single()` when it should use `.maybeSingle()`?
5. Is the order ID correct in the request?

---
