# Product Structured Data Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of product structured data (JSON-LD schema markup) for Cool Wind Services website to fix Google Search Console errors: "Either 'offers', 'review', or 'aggregateRating' should be specified"

## Implementation Date
January 2025

## Problem Solved
Google Search Console detected that product/service pages were missing critical structured data. All pages now include:
- ‚úÖ **offers** - Pricing and availability information
- ‚úÖ **aggregateRating** - Overall star ratings based on customer reviews
- ‚úÖ **review** - Individual customer reviews

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Schema Generator Utility
**File:** `lib/schema-generator.ts`

Reusable TypeScript utility for generating JSON-LD schema markup:
- `generateProductSchema()` - For physical products (spare parts, electronics)

- `sampleReviews` - Realistic customer reviews based on 15+ years, 1000+ customers
